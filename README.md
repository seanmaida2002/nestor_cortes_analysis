# Pitcher Analysis: Nestor Cortes Jr
## Summary
This project analyzes Nestor Cortes’ pitching performance from 2021–2024 using data sourced from Baseball Savant. The workflow includes:
* SQL for data extraction and preparation.
* Excel PivotTables and charts for visualization and trend analysis.
* Focus on changes in pitch characteristics (velocity, spin, movement), swing-and-miss rates, and batted-ball quality to explain his performance from 2021-2024.

I analyzed various metrics to better understand what made Nestor Cortes successful in 2021 and 2022 (where he was named an All Star) and what led to his decline in 2023 and 2024. Nestor Cortes built his success on deception — mixing arm slots, arm angles, and unique windups to keep hitters off balance despite lacking elite velocity. Even though Nestor Cortes maintained a similar strikeout percentage from 2021–2024, his walk rate spiked in 2023, which coincided with an increase in WHIP. To better understand why hitters were having more success, I analyzed his pitch mix and contact quality metrics. In 2023, hitters posted a higher hard-hit percentage, barrel rate, and in-zone contact compared to his peak seasons, showing they were squaring up pitches more often. Despite his ability to still generate whiffs, the decline in pitch movement — particularly on his fastball, slider, and sinker — made his arsenal more hittable. As a result, hitters adjusted and produced more damaging contact, driving the decline in effectiveness seen in 2023 and 2024.
